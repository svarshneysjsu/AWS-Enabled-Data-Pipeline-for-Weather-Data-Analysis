# AWS-Enabled Data Pipeline for Weather Data Analysis

## Description
This project demonstrates a robust AWS-enabled data pipeline designed for real-time weather data analysis. The pipeline automates data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis, providing actionable insights from real-time weather dataset from NOAA. It addresses the challenges of managing large-scale weather data by leveraging cloud-based solutions, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Collects live weather data from NOAA APIs. (https://noaa-swpc-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
- **Data Processing and Transformation**: Cleanses and structures raw data for analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in scalable AWS S3 storage solutions.
- **Automated Workflows**: Uses Apache Airflow for seamless data pipeline orchestration.
- **Analysis and Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing weather trends and patterns.
